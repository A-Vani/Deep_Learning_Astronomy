# Deep_Learning_Astronomy
Understanding deep learning using SDSS data to find if a galaxy is elliptical or spiral.
** The Goal ** is to understand basic deep learning techniques by using tensorflow. Here a simple neural network is implimented to find whether a galaxy is **spiral** or **elliptical**.
There are two folders available in this respository:
- DL_using_colors
- DL_using_images
DL_using_colors uses the data gathered by SDSS in the u, g, r, i and z filter, uses a sequencial model from tensorflow to create a simple NN.
DL_using_images uses the images captured by SDSS and uses a simple convolution neural network to figure out the type of the galaxy.
